1. other = 17% TOGW
2. air density at curise: 0.2388 kg/m^3
3. ** Mach = 0.762 **
4. L/D is only based on experience (L/D = 12)
5. Tail: NACA0012, NACA0010, potentially shock, but reasonable.
6. CL: using wing lift at subsonic to represent the lift of the whole plane at cruise
7. Re at optimize: 6.79e6 (a bit lower altitude); Re at curise: 6.40e6
8.  Density at 10000m (32808ft):0.4135, RE: 11.08e6; 
    Density at 15000m (49213ft):0.1948, RE: 5.22e6; 
    Designed curise (45000ft): 0.2388, RE: 6.40e6;
9. Aerodynamics calculation is only conducted at Curise settings
10. Stability: 2 passenger: can go everywhere; 4 passenger: 2 at front, 2 at rare; 
11. Initial design: 70066kg; After: 70064kg. Difference: 2kg, neglected
